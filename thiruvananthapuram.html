  <h1>Thiruvananthapuram</h1>
  <br>
  â€ƒThiruvananthapuram District is the southernmost district in the Indian state of Kerala which also houses the capital of Kerala, the city of Thiruvananthapuram. The district has three major rivers, several freshwater lakes, and over 300 ponds. Its eastern region is forested, northern regions are mostly under rubber cultivation and the remaining areas grow mixed dry-land crops of coconut, plantain, and tapioca, among others.
  <br>
<br>
<h4>How to Reach</h4><br>
National Highway 66 stretches from Kaliyikkavila at its southern end to Navaikulam near Parippally in the north, covering a distance of 80 km within the district. The Main Central Road covers a distance of 55 km, passing through Kesavadasapuram, Vembayam, Venjaramoodu, Kilimanoor, and Nilamel in the north. The Kerala Public Works Department maintains some 1,552 km of road in the district.br><br>
<h4>Places to Visit</h4> <br>
<ul>
<li><b>Agasthyarkoodam</b></li>
Agasthyarkoodam is one of the highest peaks in the Western Ghats and is the second highest peak in Kerala after Anamudi which is the highest peak in the Western Ghats. Tradition says that the great sage Agasthya lived on this peak. Noted for its abundant ayurvedic herbs, the cone shaped mountain is a centre of pilgrimage for Hindus because of Agastya, who was a confirmed bachelor.
<li><b>Vizhinjam</b></li>
Vizhinjam is believed to have been an ancient port. Now, Vizhinjam is a fishing harbour, with a light house. The Portuguese and the Dutch had commercial establishments here. The Portuguese have built a church in Vizhinjam near to the sea shore, which is still functional and is referred as the Old Vizhinjam Church.
